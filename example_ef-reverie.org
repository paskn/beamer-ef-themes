* Motivation
** What Are Prime Numbers?

*** What Are Prime Numbers?
A \alert{prime number} is a number that has exactly two divisors.

*** Example
- 2 is prime (two divisors: 1 and 2). \pause
- 3 is prime (two divisors: 1 and 3). \pause
- 4 is not prime (*three* divisors: 1, 2, and 4).

#+begin_proof
@@latex:\begin{enumerate}@@
@@latex:\item<1->@@ Suppose $p$ were the largest prime number.
@@latex:\item<2->@@ Let $q$ be the product of the first $p$ numbers.
@@latex:\item<3->@@ Then $q + 1$ is not divisible by any of them.
@@latex:\item<4->@@ Thus $q + 1$ is also prime and greater than $p$.\qedhere
